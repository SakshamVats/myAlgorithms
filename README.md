# 📌 myAlgorithms

🛠️ A collection of fundamental algorithms, implemented by hand in C++. Each algorithm includes its **implementation** and **testing** to ensure correctness and efficiency.

---

## 📂 Project Structure
- **Algorithms** are implemented in their respective **header (.h) and source (.cpp) files**.
- **Testing** is done in `testing.cpp`.
