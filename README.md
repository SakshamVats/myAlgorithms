# myAlgorithms
 Algorithms written by hand. Includes Implementation and Testing
 
 Algorithms are implemented in the their respective types' header files.
 Then, they are tested in testing.cpp.
 
 Algorithms added so far:
 1. Linear Search				(implemented using STL)
 2. Binary Search				(implemented using STL)
 3. Interpolation Search    	(implemented using STL)
 
 4. Insertion Sort				(implemented using STL)
