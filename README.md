# myAlgorithms
 Algorithms written by hand. Includes Implementation and Testing
 
 Algorithms are implemented in the their respective types' header files and source code files.
 Then, they are tested in testing.cpp.
 
 Algorithms added so far:
 1. Linear Search				(implemented using STL)
 2. Binary Search				(implemented using STL)
 3. Interpolation Search    	(implemented using STL)
 
 4. Insertion Sort				(implemented using STL)	
 5. Bubble Sort					(implemented using STL)
 6. Selection Sort				(implemented using STL)
 
 7. Depth First Search - Graph	(implemented using STL and my Graph implementation)
